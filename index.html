    <div class="top">
      <h3><i>This project serves as a comprehensive reflection on my two-year journey in programming, highlighting the<br>
          progress I have made, the skills I have developed, and the challenges I have overcome. Through this
          self-guided initiative, assigned as part of this course,<br>I aim to evaluate my personal growth in the field of
          computer science and software development. This includes an in-depth assessment of the technologies I have<br>
          learned, the projects I have completed, and how my understanding of programming concepts has evolved over<br>
          time. <i></h3>
