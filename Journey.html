    <h3> Year 1</h3>
    <details>
      <strong>
        <h4>My first year learning how to code was a truly eye-opening and formative experience. I was introduced to the fundamentals of computer programming, gaining a solid understanding of core concepts such as basic functions, logical operations, and the structure of various coding languages. This year laid the groundwork for my journey in technology, as I explored programming languages like JavaScript and learned important concepts such as binary code and simple calculations. I’m especially grateful to Ms. Hart, who played a vital role in supporting and guiding me through the learning process. Her encouragement and teaching helped me build confidence in my skills. This foundational year not only sparked my interest in programming but also solidified my decision to continue exploring the computer science pathway in the years to come.</h4>

    <h3> Year 2</h3>
    <details>
      <strong>
        <h4>My second year in programming was filled with growth and exciting new opportunities. I had the chance to build meaningful connections with peers who shared similar interests, and this collaborative environment made the learning process even more enjoyable and effective. Having classmates and friends who were willing to help and exchange ideas contributed significantly to my understanding of more advanced concepts. My teacher also played a key role in fostering a supportive and engaging classroom atmosphere. Thanks to this strong network of support—from both instructors and fellow students—I was able to deepen my knowledge and expand my skills in programming. This year reinforced my passion for technology and further motivated me to pursue a future in the field</h4>
