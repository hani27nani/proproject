      <h1>Who is Hanan</h1>
      <p style="font-size: large;">My name is Hanan Ali, and I am currently a high school student. I was born on April 12, 2007, in Somalia and have lived in the United States for the past 12 years. Having spent most of my formative years in America, I’ve grown up deeply influenced by both Somali and American cultures, which has shaped my perspective and identity in meaningful ways. This year, on April 12, I celebrated my 18th birthday—a milestone that marks an exciting new chapter in my life.</p>

          <h4>What do I like?</h4>
          <p>In my free time, I enjoy a variety of creative and relaxing activities. I have a passion for baking, where I love experimenting with different recipes and sharing homemade treats with family and friends. I also enjoy reading fantasy novels, which allow me to escape into imaginative worlds filled with adventure and wonder. In addition to reading and baking, I find joy in making small, cute crafts—it’s a calming hobby that lets me express my creativity in hands-on ways.
            I am a big fan of movies and animated series, particularly those in the Marvel cinematic universe and Japanese anime. Some of my favorite anime titles include Black Clover, Ascendance of a Bookworm, The Saga of Tanya the Evil, and Ouran High School Host Club. These shows resonate with me because of their compelling storytelling, strong characters, and the imaginative worlds they present.</p>

          <h4>>What do I Dislike?</h4>
          <p>As much as I enjoy many things, I’ve also learned more about my dislikes over time. I find it deeply frustrating when people lack empathy and treat others as if they are less than human. Kindness, respect, and understanding are values I hold dear, and I believe everyone deserves to be treated with dignity. On a lighter note, I’ve also discovered that I’m not a fan of overly sweet treats—I dislike cupcakes with heavy frosting and recently realized that I don’t enjoy macarons either.</p>

          <h4>Who Am I Overall?</h4>
          <p>Overall, I’m someone who values creativity, kindness, and continuous self-discovery. I look forward to what the future holds and the opportunities that will help me grow both personally and professionally.</p>
